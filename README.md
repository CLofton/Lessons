# Lessons
Lesson Planning experiment for our ACA Teachers

Each teacher will create a lesson plan for each class. This means 2 per week, turned in on the Friday prior to the week's lesson plans. Each lesson plan will follow the template as designed and include the class requirements such as 10 min quiz with remediation/extra practice, lesson objective, lesson plan, and homework problems. All lessons should align with the course plan and cover all objectives you'd like students to accomplish by the end of the course. 

The course objectives will be designed and implemented in detail for the fall sessions.
